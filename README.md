In this project I worked with datasets provided by Codecademy which contains data 
about biodiversity of several national parks in US. 

Project starts with basic analysis of the dataset including graphical visualisation of the conservation status for each category of species. 

Secondly, endangered species have been studied. A-B test has been conducted to check if there is
a significant difference in the percentage of protected species for several categories. 

Finally the duration of foot and mouth disease study has been proposed based on the level of significance, sample size, 
baseline and minimal detectable effect.
